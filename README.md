# wordpress_compare_blocks
Comparison of WordPress blocks using the hash.

A content map was provided by block themes in WordPress, see image 'image 1'.
Each theme has some blocks that the client can use, see image 'image 2'.
The content of each block is in json format, see the image 'image 3'

General information about the block, such as block dimensions, was collected from each json. Information was also collected about the elements contained in the block, such as the size, positioning of the element in the block and its type.

The goal is to compare blocks and find similar blocks and remove the most similar blocks.
